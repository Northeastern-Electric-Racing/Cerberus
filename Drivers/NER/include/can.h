 * @brief CAN Driver
 *        HOW TO USE THIS DRIVER:
 *          First use the start_CAN function to enable all the CAN lines
 *          You can send messages using the send_message_CAN function, this function requires a CAN_msg_t struct as the parameter.
 *          Configure a CAN_msg_t struct with the ID of the message, the Data, the length and what CAN line you want to transmit on.
 *
 *          This driver is interrupt based and as incoming messages are received they are added to a queue per can line
 *          You can receive the front of the queue by using the get_message_CAN function this will return a CAN_msg_t struct containing all the useful information
 *
 *          In the src file for this driver you will notice a lot of commented out sections pertaining to a third CAN line, ignore these for now as the MPU
 *          can only support 2 CAN lines at the moment.  This will come in handy for a third CAN line if we choose to implement one later or for a different system.
